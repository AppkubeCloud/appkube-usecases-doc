ï»¿**Use Case Title: Transaction Type Cost** 

**Actor:** Financial Analyst (or anyone with access to the financial dashboard)

**Goal:** Gain insights into the composition of transaction costs by visualizing the breakdown of different transaction types (usage, tax, credit, recurring charges).

**Precondition:** The user has logged in to the platform and has access to the financial dashboard.

**Main flow:**

1. The user navigates to the financial dashboard within the platform.
1. On the dashboard, the user locates the "Transaction Type Cost" widget.
1. The widget displays a circle chart visually representing the breakdown of transaction costs by type.
   1. Each slice of the pie chart corresponds to a specific transaction type (usage, tax, credit, recurring charges).
   1. The size of each slice is proportional to the corresponding cost amount.
   1. Hovering over a slice displays a tooltip revealing the transaction type and its associated cost percentage or absolute value (depending on preference).


**Alternative Flow:**

- If there are no transactions yet, the circle chart displays a message like "No Transaction Data Available."

**Exceptions:**

- The system encounters an error while retrieving transaction data. The user is presented with an error message and advised to contact support.

**Success Scenario:**

- Users can quickly understand the overall composition of their transaction costs at a glance.
- The circle chart provides a clear visual representation, making it easy to identify the most significant cost contributors.

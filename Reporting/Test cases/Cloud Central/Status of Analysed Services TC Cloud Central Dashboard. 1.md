|Steps|Action|Expected Result|
|Logs into the AppKube platform using their credentials.|User enters valid credentials (username and password) in the respective fields on the login page and clicks the "Login" button.|Upon successful authentication, the user should be directed to the main dashboard of the AppKube platform, where they can access various modules and features.|
|Navigates to the reporting module within the AppKube platform.|Within the platform interface, the user locates the reporting module either through the main navigation menu or by following specific instructions provided.|Upon selecting the reporting module, the user should be seamlessly transitioned to the reporting interface without encountering any errors or disruptions.|
|User selects the option to access the Cloud Central Dashboard within the reporting module.|Once inside the reporting module, the user specifically looks for and clicks on the option to access the Cloud Central Dashboard, which may be represented as a clickable link, button, or tab.|After selecting the Cloud Central Dashboard option, the user should be promptly redirected to the designated dashboard view where they can access relevant information and functionalities related to cloud management.|
|User views the Status of Analysed Services widget on the dashboard.|User visually scans the dashboard interface to locate the Status of Analysed Services widget.|The widget should be visible on the dashboard, categorizing services into four states (Savings, Optimal, Risk, and Not Analysed) and visualizing them in a donut chart.|
|User clicks on any of the states in the widget. All are similerly|User clicks on any of the states (Savings, Optimal, Risk, or Not Analysed) in the widget.|Upon clicking a state, the user should be redirected to the respective state page.|
|User views the breadcrumb on the respective state page.|User examines the breadcrumb displayed on the top of the state page.|The breadcrumb should provide navigation options for the user to go back to the previous pages.|
|User views the table displaying services in the particular state.|The table should include relevant columns such as (Instance ID, Availability Zone, Account ID, Instance Type, Optimization Type, Recommendation Reason, Recommended Instance Type, Performance Effect, Estimated Monthly Savings, and Overall Status.)|User examines the table displayed on the state page, showing services in the selected state.|
|User clicks on an Instance ID to view details.|User clicks on an Instance ID listed in the table.|Upon clicking the Instance ID, the user should be redirected to a page displaying detailed information about the selected instance.|
|User views information about the current instance and recommendations.|User examines the information displayed on the single instance page.|The page should display information about the current instance on the left side and recommendations on the right side.|
|User views utilization graphs on the single instance page.|User selects CPU, memory, storage, or network utilization to view corresponding graphs.|Utilization graphs should be displayed accurately on the right side of the page, showing resource utilization over time.|
|Click CPU utilization graphs.|Check the CPU utilization graphs there are two graphs are shown one is Current instance CPU utilization and recommended instance CPU utilization.|Graphs display CPU utilization and recommended instance CPU utilization. In all graphs show the last 6 hours of data. And thereâ€™s a filter to change the data according to the time.|
|Click memory utilization graphs.|Check the memory utilization graphs is also the same as the CPU utilization graphs there are two graphs are shown one is Current instance memory utilization and recommended instance memory utilization.|Graphs display memory utilization data for the last 6 hours with filter options.|
|Click storage utilization graphs.|Check the storage utilization graphs shows two graphs one is Disk read/ Write operations per second and Disk Read/Write Bandwidth( MiB/second ).|Graphs display   Disk read/ Write operations per second and Disk Read/Write Bandwidth( MiB/second ) successfully|
|Click network utilization graphs.|Check the network utilization graphs. Network Utilization graphs shows two graphs one is Network packets IN/OUT (Per Second) and Network IN/OUT Traffic( Per/Second ).|Graphs display  two graphs one is Network packets IN/OUT (Per Second) and Network IN/OUT Traffic( Per/Second ) display seccessfully.|

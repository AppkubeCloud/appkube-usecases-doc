# Appkube Key Use Cases 
As a Cloud Admin we would like to see the following 
    
- Infra Insight for Clouds i.e Which cloud has what workloads , say for all cloud-product enclave- landingZone combination What services (app/data whether business or common) corresponding to which products and environments are deployed.

- Services Insight for any specific  Product-Env - i.e show the 
    - Detail Topology i.e Firewall-> ApiGw -> LB -> Service Mesh -> (Business & Common Services)-> (App & Data Services for every business & common services)  
    - Detail insight of every participating components (Firewall-> ApiGw -> LB -> Service Mesh -> Services)
    - For any business or common service, how App & Data Services calls each other
    - How App service is calling other App service
    - Detail navigation of each app and data services ( Metadata + Performance/ Availability / Reliability / Security / Data Protection / EndUsage + Cost)
    - Cost & SLA scores of each app and data services
    - RCA for every App & Data Services (Performance & Reliability)
    - Find the Api performance & Reliability for each business & common services
    - RCA for every API ( Tracing & Logging)
- Departmental Insight for their products and environments
    - Spend structure of Departments- which product and services are costing more
    - Detail insights of PROD VS NON PROD spending 
- Cloud Explorer 
    - For every product enclaves created in any cloud , we would like to have the visibility on compliance / security / cost , its landing zones and clusters and all the services that is deployed either in cluster or cloud managed.
- Cluster Explorer
    - For every cluster , we would like to have the visibility on cost & sla's
- Service Explorer 
    - For every App & Data Services , we would like to have the visibility on cost & sla's & topology
- DevSecOps Tooling 
    - All Dev / Sec / Ops tools that determine the COST & SLA's of every product & services

Cloud --
There are cloud providers like AWS / AZURE / GCP who provides IT infrastructure as service(IAAS). Enterprises are moving their IT infrastructure mostly to the cloud providers(AWS,Azure,GCP).

Landing Zone --

Whenever you want to go to a cloud provider, you should create a separate account(Root Account) and create a new account for separate business units(deparments) and deploy the products and services for that business unit in that child account. every child account is called the landing zone for the organization.The correct analogy could be , you are creating a airport for your flight services.The child account is created with some security and compliance as like airport standards.

Product Enclave --

Inside the landing zone, we create several isolated network zones for different products -
That is called product enclave. Generally you deploy a pariticular product inside the product enclave.The correct analogy could be , you are creating the terminals inside the Airport(Landing Zone)

Product

Every business units runs different kinds of software products like HR department runs 
HRMS, TOUR product. Generally for every product , a separate product enclave is created where the product related all workloads get deployed and managed.

Environment

For every enterprise product, generally we keep multiple environments.Software products changes are done through multiple stages of the process to avoid regression. Developers write and build the product in Dev environment, Testers test the product in Test environment,and after testing the product, the feature is deployed to stage environment for final review and finally pushed to production. So every environment will hold the services for the product.The infrastructure that is used for production environment is actually contributing to the business , but we need to keep the overhead of the other environment. The idea is to reduce that overhead.
